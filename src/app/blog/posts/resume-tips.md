# 5 Essential Tips for Writing a Standout Resume

date: 2024-01-20

Writing a resume that stands out from the crowd can be challenging, but with the right approach, you can create a document that effectively showcases your skills and experience. Here are five essential tips to help you craft a compelling resume:

## Focus on YOUR Impact

Your resume should be a story of you. Focus on how you being there dictated a positive and impactful outcome for the company or team.

## Use Action Verbs

When describing your experience, use strong action verbs that demonstrate your accomplishments. Words like "achieved," "developed," "implemented," and "managed" show that you took initiative and produced results.

## Quantify Your Achievements

Whenever possible, include specific numbers and metrics to demonstrate your impact. For example, instead of saying "increased sales," say "increased sales by 25% over six months."

## Keep It Concise

A resume should typically be one to two pages long. Focus on the most relevant information and eliminate any unnecessary details that don't contribute to your candidacy.

## Proofread Thoroughly

Nothing undermines a resume faster than spelling or grammatical errors. Take the time to proofread your document carefully, and consider having someone else review it as well.
